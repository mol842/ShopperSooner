To run please make sure you have the following installed:

    Python 3 (I used 3.9.18)
    pip install selenium 
    npx @puppeteer/browsers install chromedriver@124 
        change the chrome driver depending on your Chrome version!
        apparently chrome works best. finally a good use for it!

To use:
1. fill out a config.py file with USERNAME, PASSWORD, DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL
2. if there is already a log.pk file, clear before use if you want.
3. change timing and settings in backgroundScheduler
4. run backgroundScheduler
